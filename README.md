# What StormShop is ...

StormShop is a project that sells scripts and subscriptions (mostly for Russian users).
You can buy it on our [website](https://nitro-storm.ru) / [telegram bot](https://t.me/storm_nitro_shop_bot) / [discord server](https://discord.gg/BNsV86yGQA) ... etc.

What about scripts? You can easily buy them on our [website](https://nitro-storm.ru). After purchasing you get the archive and README.md file with all instructions. If you wish, we can add you into private GitHub repository with the script you purchased!
